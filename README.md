## Coding a Website....kind of...
This is the official, "Keith Khaotic," website. The eventual buildup, and predecessor for [PGWECN](https://github.com/pgwecn)'s professional website.

Keith Khaotic, and various other developers tied together, are working towards ensuring that this website becomes a perfect contact page, social card, and information site. It'll eventually build the platform that PGWECN will come off of.

Built with Javascript, HTML, CSS.
