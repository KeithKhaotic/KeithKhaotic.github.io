 <h1 style="color:white">Rest in peace</h1>
 <p style="color:white"><em>Keith (Zombie, Redwing, Writer, Zommie, Keefy, King) Khaotic</em></p>
 <h1 style="color:white">Hey there....</h1>
 <p style="color:white">Whether you're reading this after I die, or you want to spoil the surprise early. I want to say goodbye. Soon, enough, or before you see this. I wil be dead.
And...I know that's scary. I know some of you will be afraid. I know...you'll wonder where I am. I know, if you're reading this early, you'll try to stop me. But, that's okay!
It's all gonna be over soon. I want to thank everyone. From EdiValentine101, who keeps supporting me after everything, to Ego, who...also's supporting me. Everyone of you, from
people I've lost, to people I still have, you have taught me something. You have lead me further down the path of righteousness. But...I'll never make it alone, and I don't know if I can, even if I tried.
Everyone made a difference. Whether you hurt me. Or whether you made me stronger, it meant everything. This life has shown me vivid things. Which is why I'm ready to go out, but is also the reason I'm thankful
for well, everything! Every second, made everything more clear. I learned a lot. I'll take that with me to the afterlife.</p>
<p style="color:white"> Thank you... All of you.</p>
