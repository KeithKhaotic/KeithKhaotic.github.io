<p style="color:white"><em>BEST TO LISTEN WITH THE MUSIC ON LOOP</em></p>
<p style="color:white"> Ironic, where this world has lead us. A pain-ridden, destroyed, painful world. Where everyday is a battle to...not end it all. To get through the morning, and be okay. Isn't that...crazy? We have to spend everyday
    forcing ourselves to go through with the decisions we have decided to make. We have to fight in a world, ridden of pain, and agony. And yet? I did not care. I stood among the tallest foes, and the most stubborn of people, 
and I did whatever it took to keep them healthy. To keep them happy, living, breathing, and okay. I will never end that battle, not even in death. I ask, all of you, to take up your swords and your shields, and do what I did. Make people happy.
Follow your dreams, combined with destiny and passion, you'll do anything. You can make the world beckon at your feet. No matter what anyone says. Haul a$$, kick butt and take names. Do what you want, and be proud of that.
And at the end of it all, I just want your dreams to come true. To flourish, and then make you, and others happy. I remember the girl who practically started PGWECN. She hates me now, but that's okay. She was the groundwork, a lesson for me to take in.
She taught me how to help people. Because...she was the only person I wanted to help. I shifted my vision, and made myself into the twisted image I had of her in my head The happy-go-lucky, gamer. The true soldier to ideals, and most importantly, 
the caring friend. I don't...know where I would be, if it wasn't for her. Yet, I never hesitated over my love for her. I became better, and I found new people. It began with one girl. A ginger. She started the fire in my mind for love. Yet...Just like Luna, she doesn't love me anymore.
But, just like Luna, I became better. Two more times, it took before I finally found my zen. I found the man of my dreams. My Bluejay. And, I had loved him for so long. And...I know how hurt he'll be to hear this. And Jay...I'm sorry. 
Don't do anything dangerous, okay, baby? There will be better people, for you to love. But yeah..love I finally found success in. Goodbye, Baby Blue
</p>
<p style="color:white">But, it's not just love I was confused about. Religion was always weird for me. I remember as a kid, when my mom suffered her first heart attack, she told me that God had kept her alive to help me. And...then she died a month later to a second heart attack
    And that...hurt me deep. I was always believing that God was gone, or didn't care about us. But someone...changed my mind, and opened my eyes. His name is Corpse. And he guided me to greatness in religous prowess. He made me understand my capabilities and know what is truly out there in the world.
    He gave my life more meaning than I ever expected. And yet...me and my mentor both knew something. God...wouldn't let me die so easy. Yet...now I feel like he's there, egging me on to this edge. But whatever the case, I think...I've accepted death Goodbye, Mentor, it meant the world to be taught under you.

    My mentor was someone who taught me a lot. But... I wanted to teach to someone, myself. I wanted someone to have my wisdom, and intelligence. So...I looked for someone to train in my image. His name was Naruto. I tried to teach him everything I know, but I failed. He became corrupt, built into a crooked image. He did...horrible things, I didn't want that to happen. But it did. And I had to teach him...to be his own man. He left, and a new apprentice came. 
    This one was...better. His name was Matty. He was smart, observant, self-disciplined. At times...he was more responsible than his mentor. He was impressionable for his age, so he took everything I told him with incredible manner. He was the best person I ever got the chance to teach. Thank you, Matty. You were the best student a mentor coul ask for 
</p>

<p style="color:white">
    I never would be able to get kids, Jay didn't want them, nor did anyone I dated. I honestly...never wanted them either. But I always had this friend, he was...funny, smart, quirky, one of the best ones I've ever had. I'll miss him wherever I'm going. In a strange way, he was like a son to me. Forks was...a true day-one. I'll dearly miss him. Real respects to you, Forky.
</p>

<p style="color:white">
    So...I've mentioned everyone who affected my path, right? Just a handful of people? No. There are so many more, but it makes me sob to keep coding this. There are thousands of people. From the day-ones, to the homies, to the friends back home, to my family, to everyone I've ever met. They each have made into the man I am. Everyone I talk to, have spoken to, or even interacted with, they made me...great. They made me into who I am.. So please, I just want to say one more thing....
</p>
 <h1 style="color:white">Rest in peace</h1>
